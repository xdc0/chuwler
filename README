Chuwler - python web crawler and scrapper

This is my attempt to write an usable program, my two main motivators
to do this are:

1. I have yet to find a tool to do the same thing that I want/need to do
2. Existing libraries/applications don't really appeal to me
3. I want to learn Python more

I hope I'll create an usable application within the near future. I'll add
more important stuff here eventually :)

REQUIREMETS

Python 2.7

-- Python Packages --
